# Earth4AllSA
Code associated to the paper *Making the Word Better with Fewer Turnarounds. A sensitivity analysis of the Earth for All model* and based on the Julia implementation of the [Earth4All model](https://earth4all.life/the-science-rp/) using the [WorldDynamics framework](https://github.com/worlddynamics/WorldDynamics.jl) and referring to the [April 2023 Vensim version](https://web.archive.org/web/20220830093115/https://earth4all.life/the-science/) available [here](https://stockholmuniversity.app.box.com/s/uh7fjh52pvh7yx1mqfwqcyxdcvegrodf/folder/170558692760). A list of the variables, equations and parameters of this implementation is available [here](https://www.pilucrescenzi.it/e4asa/e4a.html).

## How to run the code

### Prerequisites

[Install Julia](https://julialang.org/) and clone the repository: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/piluc/Earth4AllSA
```

### Setting up the environment

After starting the Julia REPL in the repository folder, we can instantiate the environment by running
```jl
julia> using Pkg;
julia> Pkg.activate(".");
julia> Pkg.instantiate();
```

We can then include the sensitivity analysis code, which also loads the `Earth4All` module, by running
```jl
julia> include("src/E4ASA.jl");
```

### Reproducing the TLTL scenario and the GL scenario

The two scenarios can be reproduced by running
```jl
julia> e4a, _, prob = e4a_sys_prob();
julia> tltl = compute_tltl_sol(prob);
julia> gl = compute_gl_sol(prob);
```
The final values of the six indicators in the two scenarios can be retrieved by running
```jl
julia> tltl[e4a.AWBI][end]
julia> gl[e4a.AWBI][end]
julia> tltl[e4a.GDPP][end]
julia> gl[e4a.GDPP][end]
julia> tltl[e4a.INEQ][end]
julia> gl[e4a.INEQ][end]
julia> tltl[e4a.OW][end]
julia> gl[e4a.OW][end]
julia> tltl[e4a.POP][end]
julia> gl[e4a.POP][end]
julia> tltl[e4a.STE][end]
julia> gl[e4a.STE][end]
```
These values are the ones reported in the table of Fig. 1 of the paper. The figure itself can be reproduced by running

```jl
julia> plot_two_sol_var(e4a, "TLTL", tltl, "GL", gl, collect(1:6), "", false, true)
```
(actually the result is an interactive version of Fig. 1). One can also plot one scenario only by running, for example,
```jl
julia> plot_sol_var(e4a, tltl, collect(1:6), "The TLTL scenario", false, true)
```

### Reproducing the GL18 scenario

This scenario can be reproduced by running
```jl
julia> gl18 = compute_gl18_sol(prob);
```
The MRE shown in Table 1 can be computed by running

```jl
julia> compare(gl[e4a.AWBI], gl18[e4a.AWBI],1)
julia> compare(gl[e4a.GDPP], gl18[e4a.GDPP],1)
julia> compare(gl[e4a.INEQ], gl18[e4a.INEQ],1)
julia> compare(gl[e4a.OW], gl18[e4a.OW],1)
julia> compare(gl[e4a.POP], gl18[e4a.POP],1)
julia> compare(gl[e4a.STE], gl18[e4a.STE],1)
```

### Executing the Sobol senisitivity analysis

To compute the Sobol indices, we first need to include the corresponding Julia code by running
```jl
julia> include("src/sobolsensitivity.jl");
```
The computation can then be done by running
```jl
julia> res = execute_sobol(10);
```
Note that the execution time depends on the number of samples to be used (in the above code is 10). In the `sobol` directory the result obtained by running the code with 10000 samples is available and it can be loaded by running
```jl
julia> res = retrieve_sobol("sobol/sobol10000.dat");
```
All the bar plots included in the paper can then be reproduced by running
```jl
julia> sobol_bar_plots(res);
```
The execution of the above code will create a directory `sobol/plots` containing, for each indicator, two HTML and two PNG files containingg the bar plots of the Sobol indices with respect to indicator (averaged over 6 and12 years, respectively). All plots use the acronym of each parameter, instead of its full name.

### Executing the local senisitivity analysis

The tornado diagrams included in the paper can be obtained by running
```jl
julia> td_awbi = tornado_diagram(e4a, prob, gl, e4a.AWBI, 120);
julia> td_gdpp = tornado_diagram(e4a, prob, gl, e4a.GDPP, 120);
julia> td_ineq = tornado_diagram(e4a, prob, gl, e4a.INEQ, 120);
julia> td_ow = tornado_diagram(e4a, prob, gl, e4a.OW, 120);
julia> td_pop = tornado_diagram(e4a, prob, gl, e4a.POP, 120);
julia> td_ste = tornado_diagram(e4a, prob, gl, e4a.STE, 120);
```
For example, the first nine elements of `td_awbi` are
```
(8, ETGBW, 20.599999999999998, -20.9)
(22, MIROTA2022, -20.1, 16.3)
(3, DACCO22100, -10.6, 10.9)
(9, GEIC, -7.5, 7.6)
(5, EETF2022, -6.2, 6.2)
(7, EPTF2022, -6.2, 6.2)
(20, USPUS2022, -5.5, 5.3)
(11, GFCO2SCCS, -9.3, 1.3)
(19, USPIS2022, -4.6, 4.5)
```
which correspond to the nine first lines of the tornado diagram shown in Fig. 5 (once again each parameter is referenced by its acronym, instead of its full name).

The spider diagram shown in Fig. 6, instead, can be generated by running
```jl
julia> perc = local_sensitivity_gl(e4a, prob, gl);
julia> spider_plot(perc, e4a, 1, [8,22,3,9,5,7,20,11,19], false, true, false)
```
(note that 1 is the index of the variable `e4a.AWBI` and `[8,22,3,9,5,7,20,11,19]` are the indices of the first nine parameters in the tornado diagram correspondign to this variable). The other spider diagrams can be generated by running a similar code for each of the remaining five variables.

### Reproducing the other scenarios

The remining scenarios analysed in the paper can be generated by running
```jl
gl6 = compute_alpha_sol(prob, [], [1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0], [3,9,11,19,20,22]);
dgl6 = compute_alpha_sol(prob, [], [2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0], [3,9,11,19,20,22]);
gl4 = compute_alpha_sol(prob, [], [0.25,2.0,0.5,2.0,2.0,2.0], [3,9,11,19,20,22]);
a = fill(1.0, 22); a[3] = 0.25; a[11] = 0.5; mgl = compute_alpha_sol(prob, [], a, collect(1:22));
```
Figs. 7-9 can then be produced similarly to what has been done in the case of the comparison of the TLTL scenario and the GL scenario.
